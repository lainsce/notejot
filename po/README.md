# How to Translate Notejot
## Basics

* You'll need to know your language's code (ex. en = English).
* Add that code to the LINGUAS file, in a new line, after the last line.
* Translate the .pot file using the PO editor of your choice (I recommend POEdit).
* Save it as <language_code>.po in this folder.

And that's it! You've successfully translated Notejot for your language!
